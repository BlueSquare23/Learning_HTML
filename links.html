  <h2>Simple link</h2>

  <p>The simplest link is created using the <b>&lt;a&gt;</b> tag like this,</p>
  <p>&lt;a href="location"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</p>
  <p>For example,</p>
  <p>Visit <a href="https://johnlradford.me">johnlradford.me<a></p>
  <p>The above example is what is known as a global link meaning that is 
the path to the front page of that site no matter where you click that 
link from. However there is also another kind of link known as a,</p>

  <a id="section2"></a> <!-- The id attribute links to the top of the screen so it ought to be put above the hr (line) tag which denotes a new section -->
  <hr>

  <h2>Relative Link</h2>

  <p>Relative links are named as such because they follow relative 
paths. An inportant thing to keep in mind about relative links is that 
they can only be use from a particular location. Whereas a global link 
can be put in any page anywhere a relative link has to reference a page 
which lives in the same directory structure as itself.</p>
  <p>Here is an example of a relative link.</p>
  <p>* Source,</p>
  <p>&lt;a href="./more_formatting.html"&gt;Relative link&lt;/a&gt; 
to a different page from our current location.</p>
  <p>* Rendered,</p>
  <p><a href="./more_formatting.html">Relative link</a> to a different page from our current location.</p>

  <a id="section3"></a>

  <h2>Linking Within Pages</h2>
  
  <p>As well as linking to pages, we may also link to specific parts 
within a page. We may do this by either creating a named anchor or 
placing an id attribute on a tag that is at the place on the page we 
would like the link to take us.</p>
  <p>To link to different section have either an id or anchor tag placed 
in that section. Think simply link to that tag.</p>
  <p>For example,</p>
  <p><a href="#section2">Jump to section 2</a></p> 
  <p>It is generally advised to use id's rather than names.</p>

  <h2>E-mail links</h2>
  <a href="section4"></a>

  <p>This is how those work but no one really cares.</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:fake@email.com">Email me</a>This is not a real 
email address.</p>

  <h2>Link Titles</h2>
  <a href="section5"></a>

  <p>Link titles give make a little title pop up whenever a user hovers 
over a link. Link titles can be created with the use of title 
elememnt.</p>
  <p>* Source,</p>
  <p>&lt;a href="https://johnlradford.me" title="A Pretty Cool Website!"&gt;johnlradford.me&lt;/a&gt;</p>
  <p>* Rendered,</p>
